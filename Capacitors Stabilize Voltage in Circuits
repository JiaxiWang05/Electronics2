Let’s dive deeper into how capacitors work to stabilize power supply fluctuations in circuits like the Wheatstone Bridge.

### How Capacitors Stabilize Voltage in Circuits

Capacitors are often used to smooth out voltage fluctuations by acting as temporary storage devices for electrical energy. When placed across the power supply in a circuit, capacitors can help filter out both low- and high-frequency fluctuations that could otherwise affect sensitive measurements, like those from an RTD in a Wheatstone Bridge.

### Why Use Two Different Types of Capacitors?

Each type of capacitor targets different frequencies of fluctuations due to their inherent properties and material compositions. Here’s how each capacitor in your setup functions:

1. **10µF Electrolytic Capacitor (Low-Frequency Filter)**
   - **Purpose**: Filters out low-frequency fluctuations in the power supply.
   - **How It Works**:
     - When the supply voltage suddenly drops, the capacitor discharges its stored energy into the circuit, helping to "fill in" the missing voltage. Conversely, when the supply voltage spikes, the capacitor absorbs some of that excess energy, reducing the spike’s impact.
     - Electrolytic capacitors, with relatively large capacitance values (like 10µF), are ideal for absorbing and smoothing out slow, gradual changes in the voltage.
   - **Typical Usage**: Electrolytic capacitors are often placed directly across the power rails (between **5V** and **GND**) at the input to the Wheatstone Bridge. This large capacitance offers “buffering” against low-frequency noise, which might be caused by slower power supply fluctuations.

2. **0.1µF Ceramic Capacitor (High-Frequency Filter)**
   - **Purpose**: Filters out high-frequency noise that may be caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI), rapid switching, or other high-speed signals in the circuit.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Ceramic capacitors respond quickly to rapid voltage changes due to their low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and low inductance. They can “short out” high-frequency signals by allowing them to pass to ground, preventing these signals from reaching the sensitive parts of the circuit.
     - High-frequency noise can be introduced from various sources, including switching power supplies, nearby digital circuits, or even external electromagnetic interference.
   - **Typical Usage**: This capacitor is placed in parallel with the electrolytic capacitor across the power supply lines. It reacts quickly to smooth out any sudden, high-frequency spikes in voltage.

### How the Capacitors Work Together

By placing both capacitors in parallel across the power supply, you effectively create a **dual-stage filter** for your power lines:
- **The 10µF electrolytic capacitor** smooths out low-frequency fluctuations by responding slowly to more gradual changes in voltage.
- **The 0.1µF ceramic capacitor** targets high-frequency noise, filtering out rapid, short-duration spikes.

Together, they create a more stable power supply, ensuring that the voltage reaching the Wheatstone Bridge circuit is as clean as possible. This setup minimizes the chances that power fluctuations will interfere with the bridge’s output voltage, thus improving the accuracy of your RTD measurements.

### Placement and Connection

- Connect both capacitors in parallel, directly across the **5V** and **GND** lines feeding into the Wheatstone Bridge.
- Proper placement is key: the capacitors should be as close as possible to the bridge input to ensure the power supply remains stable right at the point where the bridge receives power.

### Visualizing the Stabilization Process

- **Without Capacitors**: Voltage fluctuations can cause the Wheatstone Bridge output to vary independently of the RTD’s resistance changes. This can result in inaccurate temperature readings because the bridge output no longer solely represents the RTD’s behavior.
- **With Capacitors**: Voltage fluctuations are absorbed by the capacitors, resulting in a steadier supply voltage to the bridge. The output now more accurately reflects the changes in the RTD’s resistance due to temperature, improving the reliability of the measurement.

By combining both types of capacitors, you get a stable power supply that’s resistant to both gradual changes and sudden spikes, ensuring your measurements are as accurate as possible. Let me know if there’s any other detail you’d like to explore!
