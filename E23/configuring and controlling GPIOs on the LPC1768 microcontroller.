Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide on configuring and controlling GPIOs on the LPC1768 microcontroller. This includes enabling the GPIO mask, setting the GPIO direction, and controlling the output state.

### Overview of GPIO Configuration Steps

1. **Enable GPIO Mask** (`FIOMASK` Register): Ensures that specific GPIO pins are not masked out, allowing read/write operations.
2. **Set GPIO Direction** (`FIODIR` Register): Configures GPIO pins as input or output.
3. **Control GPIO Output** (`FIOSET` and `FIOCLR` Registers): Sets the output level of GPIO pins to high (3.3V) or low (0V).

### Register and Bit Information

#### General GPIO Registers for Port 1 (Example):
- **FIOMASK (Mask Register)**: `0x2009C030`
- **FIODIR (Direction Register)**: `0x2009C020`
- **FIOSET (Set Register)**: `0x2009C038`
- **FIOCLR (Clear Register)**: `0x2009C03C`

For this example, we’ll use **Port 1** GPIOs, specifically **P1.18** (commonly used for LED control). You can change the specific pin and port as needed.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Enable GPIOs in the FIOMASK Register

The `FIOMASK` register is used to mask specific GPIO pins, disabling read and write access to those pins. Setting `FIOMASK` to `0` for a specific bit enables full access to that GPIO pin.

1. **Instruction**:
   ```assembly
   LDR R0, =0x2009C030          @ Load FIOMASK address for Port 1 into R0
   MOV R1, #0x0                 @ Load 0 into R1 to unmask all pins
   STR R1, [R0]                 @ Write 0 to FIOMASK, enabling all pins
   ```
   
2. **Explanation**:
   - **`LDR R0, =0x2009C030`**: Loads the address of `FIOMASK` for Port 1 into `R0`.
   - **`MOV R1, #0x0`**: Loads `0` into `R1`, which will be used to unmask all GPIO pins on Port 1.
   - **`STR R1, [R0]`**: Writes `0` to the `FIOMASK` register, enabling access to all pins.

3. **Why We Do This**:
   - Although `FIOMASK` is often set to `0` on reset, explicitly setting it ensures code portability and clarity. This step guarantees that no pins are masked, allowing full read/write access to Port 1 GPIOs.

#### Step 2: Set GPIO Direction in the FIODIR Register

The `FIODIR` register configures each GPIO pin as input (`0`) or output (`1`). For example, to configure P1.18 as an output (commonly used for controlling an LED), we’ll set bit 18 to `1` in `FIODIR`.

1. **Instruction**:
   ```assembly
   LDR R0, =0x2009C020          @ Load FIODIR address for Port 1 into R0
   LDR R1, [R0]                 @ Load current value of FIODIR into R1
   ORR R1, R1, #0x00040000      @ Set bit 18 to 1 for output on P1.18
   STR R1, [R0]                 @ Write back the modified value to FIODIR
   ```
   
2. **Explanation**:
   - **`LDR R0, =0x2009C020`**: Loads the address of `FIODIR` for Port 1 into `R0`.
   - **`LDR R1, [R0]`**: Loads the current value of `FIODIR` into `R1` to avoid overwriting other GPIO settings.
   - **`ORR R1, R1, #0x00040000`**: Sets bit 18 to `1`, configuring P1.18 as an output. `0x00040000` corresponds to setting bit 18 in binary.
   - **`STR R1, [R0]`**: Writes the modified value of `R1` back to `FIODIR`, applying the direction change.

3. **Why We Do This**:
   - Setting the direction is necessary for controlling GPIO output. By configuring P1.18 as an output, we enable the ability to drive the pin high or low to control connected devices, such as LEDs.

#### Step 3: Set the GPIO Output to High or Low Using FIOSET and FIOCLR

The `FIOSET` and `FIOCLR` registers control the output state of GPIO pins configured as outputs:
- **`FIOSET`**: Writing a `1` to a specific bit sets the corresponding GPIO pin high (3.3V).
- **`FIOCLR`**: Writing a `1` to a specific bit clears the corresponding GPIO pin to low (0V).

##### To Set P1.18 to High (3.3V):

1. **Instruction**:
   ```assembly
   LDR R0, =0x2009C038          @ Load FIOSET address for Port 1 into R0
   MOV R1, #0x00040000          @ Set bit 18 (P1.18) to drive the pin high
   STR R1, [R0]                 @ Write to FIOSET to set P1.18 high
   ```
   
2. **Explanation**:
   - **`LDR R0, =0x2009C038`**: Loads the address of `FIOSET` for Port 1 into `R0`.
   - **`MOV R1, #0x00040000`**: Loads a value with bit 18 set to `1`, representing P1.18.
   - **`STR R1, [R0]`**: Writes this value to `FIOSET`, setting P1.18 high.

3. **Why We Do This**:
   - Writing to `FIOSET` drives the specified GPIO pin high, which is useful for turning on an LED or powering other connected devices. In this case, it would output 3.3V on P1.18.

---

##### To Clear P1.18 to Low (0V):

1. **Instruction**:
   ```assembly
   LDR R0, =0x2009C03C          @ Load FIOCLR address for Port 1 into R0
   MOV R1, #0x00040000          @ Set bit 18 (P1.18) to drive the pin low
   STR R1, [R0]                 @ Write to FIOCLR to set P1.18 low
   ```
   
2. **Explanation**:
   - **`LDR R0, =0x2009C03C`**: Loads the address of `FIOCLR` for Port 1 into `R0`.
   - **`MOV R1, #0x00040000`**: Loads a value with bit 18 set to `1`, representing P1.18.
   - **`STR R1, [R0]`**: Writes this value to `FIOCLR`, setting P1.18 low.

3. **Why We Do This**:
   - Writing to `FIOCLR` clears the specified GPIO pin, setting it to low (0V). This is useful for turning off an LED or deactivating other connected devices. In this case, it would output 0V on P1.18.

MOV R1, #0x00040000          @ Set bit 18 (P1.18) to drive the pin low

```

### Explanation Recap

1. **Enable GPIOs in FIOMASK**: Sets FIOMASK to `0` to allow read/write access to all pins on Port 1.
2. **Set Direction in FIODIR**: Configures P1.18 as an output pin by setting bit 18 in `FIODIR`.
3. **Control Output with FIOSET/FIOCLR**: Sets or clears P1.18, allowing control over the voltage level (3.3V or 0V) on the pin.
