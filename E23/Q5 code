   LDR R1, [R0]             @ Load the current value of AD0GDR into R1

Load Address (LDR R0, =0x4003C004): Prepares the address of AD0GDR for checking the DONE bit.
Label the Loop (wait_for_conversion:): Marks the start of a loop to monitor the DONE bit.
Load AD0GDR Value (LDR R1, [R0]): Reads the current value of AD0GDR to check its status.
Check the DONE Bit (TST R1, #0x80000000): Tests bit 31 to see if the ADC conversion is complete.
Branch if Not Complete (BEQ wait_for_conversion): Loops back to continue checking until the DONE bit is set.
