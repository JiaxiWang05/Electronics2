Here’s a summary of the program’s flow:

Setup: Initialize serial communication at 9600 bps.
Loop (Main Functionality):
Read the analog voltage at the Wheatstone Bridge’s output points (A0 and A1).
Convert the ADC readings from digital values to actual voltages.
Calculate the differential voltage between Points A and B, representing the bridge’s output.
Print the voltage difference to the Serial Monitor with a descriptive label and 4 decimal places for precision.
Pause for 1 second before taking the next measurement.
